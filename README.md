thumbmontage
============

Thumbnail generator for Linux.  Target directory needs to be set in the file (search for os.walk).  Script will then crawl all files in the directory and all sub-directories generating thumbnails local to where the script is ran.

Requires Python 2.7.x, developed on Linux (Mint 14).  May not work on other platforms.
